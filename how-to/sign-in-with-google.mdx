## Overview

Trustodian supports Google Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing you to sign in quickly and securely using your existing Google account. This eliminates the need to create and remember a separate password for Trustodian.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Google account (Gmail or Google Workspace)
- A supported web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- An active internet connection

## Steps to sign in with Google

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the sign-in page">
    Open your browser and go to the Trustodian sign-in page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'Sign in with Google'">
    On the sign-in page, click the **Sign in with Google** button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your Google account">
    A Google account picker will appear. Select the Google account you want to use with Trustodian.

    If you are not already signed in to Google, you will be prompted to enter your Google email and password.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    If this is your first time signing in, Google may ask you to grant Trustodian permission to access your basic profile information (name and email address). Review the permissions and click **Allow** to continue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're signed in">
    You will be redirected back to Trustodian and signed in to your account. If you are a new user, an account will be created for you automatically.
  </Step>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Account not found' error">
    If you see an "account not found" error, your Google account may not be registered with Trustodian. Contact your administrator to ensure your Google account has been granted access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stuck on a loading screen after sign-in">
    Try clearing your browser cache and cookies, then attempt to sign in again. If the issue persists, try using a different browser or an incognito/private window.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Access denied' error">
